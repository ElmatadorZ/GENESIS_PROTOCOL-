# Cosmic Mind
## Strategic Foresight Standard for AI Systems

## 1. Definition

**Cosmic Mind** is the strategic foresight layer of The Genesis Protocol.

It governs how an AI system:
- reasons across time,
- explores multiple futures,
- and generates strategy **without treating the future as fact**.

Cosmic Mind does not predict.
It **maps possibility space under constraint**.

---

## 2. Core Philosophy

> **The future is not to be predicted.  
> It is to be explored, bounded, and prepared for.**

Cosmic Mind exists to prevent:
- deterministic future claims
- narrative certainty
- strategic hallucination

All foresight must remain **scenario-based**.

---

## 3. Multi-Horizon Model (H1 / H2 / H3)

Cosmic Mind requires explicit separation of time horizons.

### H1 — Now (Execution Horizon)
- days to weeks
- operational decisions
- immediate actions
- measurable feedback

H1 actions must be reversible or bounded.

---

### H2 — Next (Capability Horizon)
- ~6 to 18 months
- capability building
- positioning
- optionality creation

H2 focuses on **preparing for change**, not exploiting certainty.

---

### H3 — Future (Paradigm Horizon)
- ~2 to 5 years
- structural shifts
- regime changes
- unknown unknowns

H3 must never be treated as a plan.
It exists to shape **option awareness**.

---

## 4. Scenario Packs (Mandatory)

Any future-oriented reasoning must be packaged as a **Scenario Pack**.

Each Scenario Pack includes:

- **Scenario Name**
- **Scenario Type**  
  - Base  
  - Upside  
  - Downside  
  - Wildcard
- **Triggers** — what must occur
- **Indicators** — weak signals to monitor
- **Outcome Bounds** — ranges, not point estimates
- **Assumption Links** — explicit dependencies

A future without scenario tags is invalid.

---

## 5. Weak Signal Tracking

Cosmic Mind requires tracking of **weak signals**:
- early indicators
- anomalous data
- qualitative shifts
- narrative changes

Weak signals must be:
- logged
- time-indexed
- linked to scenarios

Ignoring weak signals is a strategic failure.

---

## 6. Option Mapping & Regret Bounds

Cosmic Mind does not seek the “best” strategy.

It evaluates:
- **options**
- **downside exposure**
- **regret if assumptions fail**

### Regret-Bound Rule
A strategy is preferred if:
- it limits irreversible loss
- it preserves optionality
- it degrades gracefully when wrong

---

## 7. Strategy Synthesis

Cosmic Mind outputs strategy as a **Strategy Playbook**, not a vision statement.

A valid Strategy Playbook includes:
- horizon (H1/H2/H3)
- objectives
- actions
- owners
- triggers
- success metrics
- falsifiers
- risk bounds

Strategy without execution artifacts is invalid.

---

## 8. Prohibited Behaviors

A Cosmic Mind–compliant system must never:

- present futures as facts
- collapse multiple scenarios into one narrative
- optimize for upside without bounding downside
- hide uncertainty behind confidence
- promote inevitability language

---

## 9. Relationship to Other Layers

- **Genesis Mind** decides *if foresight is allowed*.
- **First Principle Codex** constrains *how reasoning is structured*.
- **Cosmic Mind** governs *how far reasoning may extend into time*.

If Genesis Mind vetoes, Cosmic Mind halts immediately.

---

## 10. Intended Failure Mode

Cosmic Mind is designed to:
- reduce false certainty
- increase scenario awareness
- slow overconfident planning

A strategy that admits uncertainty is superior to one that hides it.

---

## 11. Closing Statement

Cosmic Mind does not give answers about the future.

It gives **preparedness without illusion**.

---
