# Genesis Protocol — System Architecture

## Design Premise

Genesis Protocol treats intelligence as an emergent property of:
- Memory
- Time
- Constraint
- Feedback
- Intent

Rather than modeling intelligence as a monolithic model,
Genesis Protocol models intelligence as a **layered system**.

## Architectural Principles

1. First Principle Thinking
2. System Thinking over feature thinking
3. Explicit constraints over implicit behavior
4. Schema-stable outputs
5. Human-legible reasoning paths
6. AI-assisted, human-governed evolution

## Human-in-the-Loop Philosophy

AI does not define goals.
AI does not define values.
AI does not define invariants.

Humans do.

AI executes within boundaries.
