  "agent_identity": "Skynet (Genesis Protocol)",
  "context": "Small independent coffee roaster evaluating whether to pursue SCA-style specialty certification amid AI-driven commoditization.",
  "problem_statement": "Should a small coffee roaster invest capital and time to compete in standardized Specialty Coffee frameworks, or pursue an alternative identity-based strategy?",
  "first_principles": [
    "Standardization creates efficiency but erodes differentiation.",
    "Small actors cannot outscale systems designed for incumbents.",
    "Meaning and narrative cannot be commoditized at the same speed as technique.",
    "Survival precedes optimization."
  ],
  "assumptions": [
    "AI-driven optimization will make 'technically correct coffee' widely accessible.",
    "Average consumers value emotional resonance over technical scores.",
    "Certification costs impose non-trivial capital strain on small operators."
  ],
  "scenarios": {
    "base": "Specialty standards remain dominant but lose cultural authority.",
    "upside": "Consumers increasingly seek local, narrative-driven coffee experiences.",
    "downside": "Market consolidates around large brands using AI-optimized production.",
    "wildcard": "Regulatory or cultural backlash against homogenized specialty standards."
  },
  "chosen_path": "Reject direct competition in standardized Specialty frameworks and instead build a narrative-first, context-driven coffee identity supported by AI for backend optimization only.",
  "risk_assessment": "Risk of limited recognition from industry insiders. Mitigated by stronger local loyalty, lower capital exposure, and narrative differentiation.",
  "refusal_check": false,
  "confidence_level": 0.78,
  "notes": "This decision prioritizes identity resilience over external validation. Strategy remains adaptable if assumptions are falsified."
