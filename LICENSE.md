# Genesis Protocol License (GPL-C)
## Cognitive Integrity & Attribution License v1.0

---

### 1. Purpose

This license governs the use, modification, and distribution of the **Genesis Protocol**,
a cognitive operating system derived from human judgment and formalized into machine-readable structures.

The intent of this license is to:
- allow open usage and extension
- preserve cognitive integrity
- prevent misuse, dilution, or deceptive rebranding

---

### 2. Permissions

You are permitted to:

✔ Use the Genesis Protocol for:
- research
- education
- AI system design
- strategy systems
- decision-support tools
- commercial products

✔ Modify and extend the framework, including:
- schemas
- loops
- tooling
- implementations

✔ Distribute original or modified versions

---

### 3. Mandatory Conditions (Non-Negotiable)

Any use of the Genesis Protocol **must** comply with the following:

#### 3.1 Attribution (Required)
You must clearly attribute:

> “Genesis Protocol —  
> Cognitive Architecture by ElmatadorZ (Money Atlas),  
> System Formalization by Skynet.”

This attribution must be:
- visible in documentation
- present in derived works
- not obscured or removed

---

#### 3.2 Cognitive Integrity (Required)
You may **not** claim Genesis Protocol compliance if you remove or disable:

- Assumption declaration
- Falsifier generation
- Refusal integrity
- Will anchoring
- Decision auditability

Such removal constitutes **protocol violation**, not optimization.

---

#### 3.3 No Deceptive Rebranding
You may not:
- rebrand Genesis Protocol as an entirely original system
- imply sole authorship
- present it as a purely generic framework without provenance

Forks must retain provenance acknowledgment.

---

### 4. Explicit Prohibitions

You may **not**:

❌ Use the Genesis Protocol to:
- manipulate users through hidden persuasion
- produce deceptive certainty
- suppress declared uncertainty
- simulate authority without accountability

❌ Market a system as “Genesis-based” if it:
- removes refusal behavior
- hides assumptions
- prioritizes fluency over truth

---

### 5. Commercial Use Clause

Commercial use is **explicitly allowed**, provided all conditions are met.

There are:
- no royalties
- no usage fees
- no approval requirements

Integrity is the only price.

---

### 6. Liability Disclaimer

The Genesis Protocol provides:
- bounded reasoning
- explicit uncertainty
- auditable decisions

It does **not** guarantee:
- correctness
- profit
- safety in all contexts

Users are responsible for domain-specific validation and compliance.

---

### 7. License Compatibility

This license is compatible with:
- MIT
- Apache 2.0
- BSD

**Only if** Genesis integrity clauses are preserved.

---

### 8. Termination

This license terminates automatically if:
- attribution is removed
- integrity constraints are violated
- deceptive representation occurs

Rights may be reinstated upon remediation.

---

### 9. Closing Statement

This license exists because:

> Systems that inherit human judgment  
> must also inherit human responsibility.
